## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (for running the PostgreSQL server in a container)

### Local Deployment

#### Setup Script

If you want an easy setup, the `setup.sh` script automates the installation and configuration process. This is perfect for users who are not familiar with manual setup or want to save time.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adhamafis/curiopay.git
   cd curiopay
   ```

2. **Run the setup script**:
   The `setup.sh` script will guide you through the environment setup and run Docker Compose to configure a local PostgreSQL server for the app. Simply run:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   During the setup, the script will:

   - Create and configure a `.env` file with the necessary environment variables.
   - Set up Docker Compose to run a PostgreSQL server locally.
   - Prompt you to enter sensitive information for your `.env` file (e.g., SMTP credentials, database URL, etc.).

3. **Environment Variables**:

   The script will help you fill out your `.env` file. Hereâ€™s an example of the environment variables you'll need to configure:

   ```env
   BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your-token-here
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/curiopay
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   SMTP_PASS=your-email-password
   SMTP_FROM=your-email@gmail.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
   CRON_SECRET=your-cron-secret
   ```

   Replace the placeholder values with your own information:
   - **BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN**: Token for managing BLOB storage (if needed).
   - **DATABASE_URL**: Your PostgreSQL connection string. This will be auto-generated by Docker.
   - **SMTP settings**: Required for email notifications.
   - **NEXTAUTH_SECRET**: A secret used for authentication sessions (generate using a secure random string).

### For Advanced Users

If you prefer manual setup or want full control over your environment, you can skip the `setup.sh` script and configure everything yourself:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adhamafis/curiopay.git
   cd curiopay
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` file**:  
   Manually create and configure your `.env` file with the necessary environment variables (refer to the example above).

3. **Run Docker Compose**:  
   Set up a local PostgreSQL server by running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
---

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can:

- **Track your expenses**: Add your income and expenses, and categorize them by type (e.g., groceries, entertainment, rent).
- **Set your budget**: Define a budget on your profile page and get alerts if you exceed it.
- **Interact with AI**: Choose your LLM provider and start chatting to get financial insights tailored to your spending habits.
- **Export Data**: Export your income and expense data in CSV/JSON format after verifying your email.
